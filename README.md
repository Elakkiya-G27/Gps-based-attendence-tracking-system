# Gps-based-attendence-tracking-system
"Developed a GPS-based Attendance Tracking System using Flask, Google Maps API, and SQLite. The system verifies a user’s live location, allows check-in only within an authorized radius, and stores attendance records securely. Built real-time maps, geolocation validation, and an easy-to-use web interface."
